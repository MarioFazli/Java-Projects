# Square Matrix

If we have M X M matrix we should find all the 2 X 2 subatrix and :

**findMaxSum()**  - returns biggest sum of elements of 2 X 2 submatrix

**printAll()** - prints the index of the row and column of the submatrix with the biggest sum (only the top left element)

Numbers in the matix should be generated randomly and the number of rows should be entered by the user
